\title{Networked coincidences.}
\description{
\code{netCoin} produces a netCoin object of coincidences. Its input has to be two data.frames: one of attributes of events or nodes, and the other of attributes of the edges or links. 
}
\value{
This function returns a \code{netCoin} object.
If the 'dir' attribute is specified, the function creates a folder in the computer with an HTML document named index.html which contains the produced graph. This file can be directly opened with your browser and sent to a web server to work properly.
}
